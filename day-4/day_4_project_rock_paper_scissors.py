####### Debugging challenge: #########
#Try running this code and type 5.
#It will give you an IndexError and point to line 32 as the issue.
#But on line 38 we are trying to prevent a crash by detecting
#any numbers great than or equal to 3 or less than 0.
#So what's going on?
#Can you debug the code and fix it?
