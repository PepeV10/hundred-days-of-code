"""

Instructions
Write a program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name.

Important
Don't add a prompt to the input() function. e.g. use name = input() rather than: name = input("What's your name?")

input() will give you access to anything that's typed in the input pane.

Hint
You will need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

e.g. https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow

Example Input:
Jane
Jane = 4 characters
Example Output:
4
"""

# Provide any name in the input pane below.
# That value can be accessed using the input() function.
# Don't put anything inside the input() function!
user_name = input()
length_user_name = len(user_name)
print(length_user_name)
